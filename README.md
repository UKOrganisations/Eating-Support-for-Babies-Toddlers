## 🧪 Suspected Allergies, Intolerances or Reflux?

Around half of the children we work with have undiagnosed allergies — often to dairy. We help identify and manage symptoms of reflux, intolerances, and other dietary concerns, supporting families through diagnosis and daily life adjustments.

We don’t just look at what’s on the plate — we look at the whole mealtime experience, helping your child eat well and feel well.
